==============

A simple gulp file / scaffolding as presented at JavaScript Atlanta, July 21st, 2014.  

Special thanks to [vunify.com](http://www.vunify.com/) for allowing portions of their Gulpfile to be reused for this demo.

## install + run

You'll need [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed locally.  This is one of the dependencies in `package.json`. To install these, make sure you have [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed (current versions at the time of this writing come bundled with npm).

Simply type

    npm i
    
to install all the dependencies.  

now, to run it, type

    gulp
